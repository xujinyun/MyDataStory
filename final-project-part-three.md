# The final data story
[For-hiring vehicle drivers' best assistant](https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/uber-drivers-dilemma/index.html)


# Changes made since Part II
<!-- > Include few paragraphs that reflects on changes you made since the completion of Part II.  -->
I made several changes to the data visualization following feedback from the interview, instructor, and TS. Firstly, I used a consistent color scale of light blue and orange for all visualizations, which are comfortable for readers to view and can aid in comprehension. To improve visualization clarity, I reduced the transparency of most plots to soften their appearance. Additionally, I provided clear titles and captions for each visualization to ensure understanding for readers who may skip the text and jump directly to the graphs. For the revenue graph, I used a bar chart for total revenue and a line chart for average revenue to highlight their respective properties. For the cost graph, I used gray circles to represent all trivial locations, allowing the audience to focus only on the top locations.

I also emphasized the call to action at the end of the story. Previously, my call to action was not clear, and readers had to navigate through technical descriptions. By placing the call to action at the very end of the story, it now serves as an advertisement for my product, encouraging people to try it today.

To make the story more comprehensive, I incorporated some side references instead of solely presenting recorded data. This included adding interviews with real Uber drivers to provide a more empathetic perspective. Additionally, I included data on other transportation methods to highlight the importance of FHV and its audience.

## The audience
<!-- > Talk about who you identified as the audience for your final data story.  Include any other information you've used that helped you narrow the focus (e.g. insights from your interviews, personas, etc.).  Note any specific adjustments you made to your final project to make it work for your audience. -->

For my final data story, I identified FHV drivers as the primary audience. This decision was based on the realization that my previous audience identification could lead to ambiguity in the call to action. By focusing on FHV drivers, I aimed to make the call to action more relevant and compelling for them.

In narrowing down my audience, I also ensured that the story remains accessible to all readers. This approach allows everyone to gain insights into the taxi market and understand why there are sometimes long wait times for a ride.


## Final design decisions
<!-- > You can specifically break out your design decisions here, or include it under *Changes made since Part II* and delete this section. Talk about the design decisions you had to make along the way, and reflect on anything in particular that stands out to you that you learned working through the process.  Include any other information that helps round out your data story.  -->

In addition to the design decisions mentioned in Part II, one key decision I made was regarding the structure of my story. The NYC taxi data contains a wealth of information but lacks differentiation, making it difficult to discern the emotions and stories behind the data. To address this, I framed the story around a central question for FHV drivers: their routine choice. This decision was driven by the realization that the lack of a common criteria for making choices in their routine could be a compelling narrative angle. It also made my pitch for a new product more reasonable, as it aims to solve this problem.

Through this structure, I aimed to not only present the data but also to tell a story that resonates with the experiences and challenges faced by FHV drivers. This approach not only adds depth to the data but also makes it more engaging and relatable for the audience.

# Final thoughts
<!-- > You can summarize any final thoughts / reflections that don't fit well in the previous sections here.  How did it go?  What did you run out of time for, or wish you had a chance to revisit?  What were you most excited about?  Include any final reflections as you think they might help us understand your process.  If you already included such reflections elsewhere, you can delete this section.  -->


Working through this process taught me the importance of storytelling in data analysis. It's not just about presenting numbers; it's about crafting a narrative that brings those numbers to life and makes them meaningful to the audience. It also highlighted the importance of understanding the context and background of the data, as this can greatly impact the way it is interpreted and the stories that can be derived from it.

Overall, this project has been a valuable learning experience, and I believe the final data story effectively conveys the insights and messages I intended to share.
