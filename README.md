# Portfolio
This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at CMU!  Here's where all my cool work will go. Want to know more about my cool ROBOT? Contact me!
# About me
Hi! This Jinyun Xu from Robotics Institute. Surprise! I have always had an obsession with the graphs appearing in my papers and slides. That's why I come here to study data visualization. I hope it can enhance my papers and slides.

# What I hope to learn
- I want to learn how to make my graphs on paper fantastic. Although I am proficient in creating graphs in PowerPoint, I aspire to enhance my skills further.
- I have a strong interest in data because it holds truth, but its impact depends on how the story is told. I hope to acquire the ability to **tell** and to *tell*.
- As a robotic engineer, my goal is to continue building cool and innovative projects.

# Portfolio

All my data stories are here:

## Assignment 1: [Visualizing government debt](visualizing-government-debt)
This is the first assignment for visulization of general government debt data using website tool and **Tableau**. This is my first time with **Tableau**. Click the link to check my work!

## Assignment 3&4: [Critique by Design](critique-by-design)
For this assignment, make sure you set up and link to a new page.  This page is linking to a new Markdown document called `critique-by-design.md`.  

## Final project
Here it might be helpful to include a high-level description of your final project. 
[Part I](final-project-part-one)
[Part II](final-project-part-two)
[Part III](final-project-part-three)
