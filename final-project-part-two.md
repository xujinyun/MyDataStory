# Interactive Map for the final project
<a href="./Final2/interactive_map.html" title="interactive_map">interactive_map</a>


# Wireframes / storyboards
> Using your sketches developed last week, further develop your story outline and relevant components visually through the use of wireframing / storyboards. Using your outline as a guide, include high-fidelity, individual draft data visualizations of the critical elements of your story you want to share with your reader. Note: you can build these elements out directly in Shorthand this week if you wish.  Reminder: this template is intended to help, but it doesn't substitute for reading through the full homework assignment!  The assignment page on Canvas includes many important details for completing Part II of the final project.

# User research 

## Target audience
<!-- > Include your approach to identifying representative individuals, and who you hope to reach with your story.  -->

In identifying representative individuals, I focus on New York City's For-Hire Vehicle (FHV) drivers, aiming to reach both independent drivers and large companies like Uber. The story is crafted to resonate with drivers, offering insights into evaluating operating conditions from their perspective. Towards the conclusion, we present a specialized algorithm tailored for companies, such as Uber, to optimize operations based on the drivers' experiences and insights.


## Interview script

| Goal | Questions to Ask |
|------|------------------|
|Make sure audience can understand the story easily.      |    Can you describe to me what this is telling you?              |
|Make sure all points are clear       | Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?                 |
|Find out the story arc      |Which part do you think is eye-catching                  |
|Make improvement | Any suggestion for me in all aspects.|


## Interview findings

| Questions               | Entrepreneur (20-30) | MCDS Student (20-30) | Robotics Researcher (20-30) |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------|-------------|
| Can you describe to me what this is telling you? | The website talks about the approaches for high-volume FHV drivers (Uber or Lyft) to optimize their profits by choosing the appropriate pickup locations and pickup times. |This blog page leverages data analysis and visualization to suggest what are the recommended routines that Uber drivers in the NYC area should follow in order to maximize their profits.             |This website provides me with valuable insights on optimizing routes and maximizing profits for Uber drivers. It effectively explains the strategies behind selecting the most efficient routes to enhance earnings while considering factors such as time management, revenue generation, and cost optimization.             |
|Is there anything you find surprising or confusing? |The title mentions the uber driver dilemma, while it seems the dilemma is not described in detail on the website, which makes me feel curious.|Surprising: surprise to find no Lyft name in the pie chart of FHV company ratio. Confusing: I am confused about what the location name in the Cost plot stands for. Are they pick-up or drop-off locations?             | I'm really surprised by the clear and inviting style of the website. The information I needed was readily available at first glance. The use of language and data visualizations on the site is seamlessly logical, ensuring an easy-to-follow experience. Additionally, the art-style of the website strikes a perfect balance, delivering a rational message in a relaxed manner, which I found particularly appealing.            |
|Which part do you think is eye-catching|	All the graphs and charts are well-make and eye-catching, especially the top pickup locations and pickup timeline. It’s very helpful to read the visualized data and better understand the analysis.|1. the design of the entire web page, specifically the usage of photographs in the beginning, middle, and end of the page is brilliant. 2. The highlighted short sentences in each section do a great job in involving the audience to the real scenarios depicted by the data visualization.               |The plots on the website are not only visually appealing but also highly informative and clear, making it easy to grasp complex concepts. Additionally, the use of large, beautiful pictures between different sections adds an extra layer of aesthetic appeal to the overall design.             |
| Any suggestion for me in all aspects.|The pictures, texts, and colors chosen are great and match well with the content in general. One suggestion is the color of the tile could be adjusted to be more different from the background image so that it could be seen more clearly.| 1. For the web page layout, it looks better to leave all subtitles on its own row and ensure all paragraphs' columns align. 2. For each plot, maybe a well-defined title is necessary, for example, the revenue plot could be clarified more by adding the title “Average 1-day revenue in different NYC areas”, so the audience immediately understand what do you mean by “average” in the plot and “total” in the corresponding text analysis.             |It would be beneficial to explore the diverse applications of the algorithm further. I strongly believe that this method has the potential to be applied to various other scenarios beyond its current use. Providing insights into these potential applications could enhance the website's value and appeal to a wider audience.             |

Utilizing Tableau alone proves insufficient in capturing the complexity of the narrative. By synergizing Python, Tableau, and Shorthand, I am able to construct a comprehensive story. 

Furthermore, I aim to enrich the narrative by integrating additional datasets, showcasing the challenges faced by drivers and passengers in NYC.

Interesting findings: some interviewer focus on the visual effect, some focus on the backend logic, while the research come from the same area focus on my algorithm :)
